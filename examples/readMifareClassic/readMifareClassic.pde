    This example will wait for any ISO14443A card or tag, and
    depending on the size of the UID will attempt to read from it.

    If the card has a 4-byte UID it is probably a Mifare
    Classic card, and the following steps are taken:

    Reads the 4 byte (32 bit) ID of a MiFare Classic card.
    Since the classic cards have only 32 bit identifiers you can stick
	them in a single variable and use that to compare card ID's as a
	number. This doesn't work for ultralight cards that have longer 7
	byte IDs!

    Note that you need the baud rate to be 115200 because we need to
	print out the data and read from the card at the same time!

This is an example sketch for the Adafruit PN532 NFC/RFID breakout boards
This library works with the Adafruit NFC breakout
